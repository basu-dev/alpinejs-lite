# Alpinejs Lite

<b style='color:red'>WARNING: Please do not use this in production</b>

This is my own light version of Alpine js.
It has most of basic Alpinejs features but not optimized properly, not tested and not completed either.

It is a fun project. Its developed solely for educational purpose

You can clone, play around and look how a handy library
like alpine work under the hood.

## Learner Guide

There are two branches mainly

### Master Branch

Master branch is advanced and includes many more features
like x-for, x-if, Alpine.data() api and so many more. If you are here to learn, you should check this out after you check
out <b>Original</b> branch.

### Original Branch

There is another branch named <b>Original Branch</b>. There is around 100 lines of code and another 100 lines of comments
showing just bare minimum to start with. You can see how
alpinejs concept was started in this branch.
